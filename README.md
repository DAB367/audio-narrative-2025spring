Add own Readme
To Do:
A plain text (.txt) or markdown (.md) file, explaining in at least 300 words what you're showing us in this preview. Feel free also to ask questions or lay out next steps for yourself!
An updated list of assets (either directly in README.md or in a separate assets.md / credits.md file), indicating which the files you've actually recorded or otherwise obtained. Add source documentation for any outside sources â€“ along with your permission to use them (e.g. licenses, fair use; see Writer/Designer p. 160-165).
Finally, export a playable mp3 file, both as a snapshot and just in case something goes awry with your Audacity project file.
