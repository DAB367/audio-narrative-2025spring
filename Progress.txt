This preview is the opening scene for my project. The story starts with a woman getting out of her car. She has parked at the beach and is looking for her friend. I broke up the opening and closing of the car door to give her some time to get out of the car. The sound of the waves and the gull are softened before the door opens as they would be a bit muffled inside of the car. The sound still needs to be adjusted so that it is louder on the left as she gets out of the car. How do I adjust a small portion of the audio to be louder on the left and then balance out? Do I need to split it to accomplish that? Maybe I should add some music on the radio in the beginning or the engine turning off. Would that create a better entrance for the piece? Next steps would be to get the sounds for her footsteps on the asphalt of the parking lot and the sand of the beach to show her walking. Should the gulls be closer to the parking lot than the beach? Would they be more likely to get food from people dropping it at the parking lot or on the beach? I need to finish writing and then record the narrative. How should I finish the piece? Just fade to ocean waves or ocean waves and sea gulls? I find it amazing how much time adjusting a few seconds of sound takes. Audio recording is a lot more work than I realized. I had figured that recording the narrative and getting it the way I want it might have taken the longest for this project but now I see that the background might take the most time to construct.
